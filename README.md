# üõí H&M Graph Neural Network Recommendation System

This project builds a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based recommendation system** on the **H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations dataset (Kaggle)**.  

Customers and articles are modeled as a **heterogeneous bipartite graph**, and a GNN (GraphSAGE) is trained to perform **link prediction** for personalized product recommendations.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations)  

- **Graph Construction**:  
  - **Nodes**:  
    - `customer`: 1,371,980 nodes with 9-dimensional features (demographics & embeddings)  
    - `article`: 105,542 nodes with 683-dimensional features (metadata & embeddings)  
  - **Edges**: 31,788,324 purchase interactions (customer ‚Üî article), with time and edge attributes  

- **Downsampled Graph** (for demonstration / compute efficiency):  
  - Customers: 100,000  
  - Articles: 82,477  
  - Edges: 2,327,067 interactions  

- **Model**:  
  - Implemented **Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks** with PyTorch Geometric  
  - Experimented with **GraphSAGE** layers  
  - Learned refined embeddings for customers & articles  

- **Task**: **Link prediction** ‚Üí Predict if customer *X* will purchase article *Y*
